I have copied all the jsonplaceholder data to my database.

So, actually, you can use any user from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to test my project. (**Username** is username, **Password** is street (contain the space))

You can also use Google to login. It will automatically direct to main view. Then you can go to profile to link account. After put correct username and password to link, it will loggout and google account will be replaced by local account. Then you can use either local account or google account to login.<br>
After linked google account to local account. You can click unlink. It will remove the google account information. Then you can only login by local account. Or create a new account by login with Google account.
